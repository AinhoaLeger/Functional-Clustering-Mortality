# Scripts and source files

In this folder there are currently three R scripts:

*	"01-fda_smoothing": data preparation and functional smoothing.
*	"02-fda_clustering": functional clustering of mortality data.
*	"03-fpca": functional principal component analysis of mortality data.

The folder also contains my own version of function “myImagePlot” and a source file “selectyears” to facilitate plotting the curves in the clusters.
